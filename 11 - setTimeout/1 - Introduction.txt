In this example, the showMessage function will be executed every 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds) using setInterval(). After 10 seconds (10000 milliseconds), the clearInterval() function is called to stop the interval. The messages are logged to the console for demonstration purposes.

You can adjust the interval time and the duration based on your requirements.
