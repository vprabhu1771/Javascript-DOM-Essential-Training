In JavaScript, you can use the Geolocation API to retrieve the user's current location. The Geolocation API provides a simple method to obtain the latitude and longitude coordinates of the user's device. Here's a basic example of how you can use it:

In this example:

    We check if the Geolocation API is supported in the user's browser using the navigator.geolocation property.
    If supported, we use the getCurrentPosition method to get the current position.
    The success callback function receives a position object containing the coordinates (latitude and longitude), which we then access and log.
    The error callback function handles different types of errors that might occur during the geolocation request.

Keep in mind that the user needs to grant permission for the browser to access their location. Additionally, this code may not work on insecure origins (non-HTTPS) in some modern browsers, as they have tightened security requirements for certain features, including geolocation.
